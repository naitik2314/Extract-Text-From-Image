# Extract-Text-From-Image
I am an engineering Student, and I know the value of time, because I spend most of time on writing Assignments, due to the time constraints, I usually click images of the WhiteBoard of what the teacher taught today, and feed it to this code, so that I can extract text from the image and add it to Google Docs.
